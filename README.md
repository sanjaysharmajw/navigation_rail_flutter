#### Why Do We Need a Navigation Rail in Flutter?
A Navigation Rail is a compact, vertical navigation component introduced by Flutter to enhance navigation on larger screens (such as tablets, desktops, and foldable devices). It provides an efficient way to switch between different sections of an app while maintaining screen real estate.

## Benefits of Using Navigation Rail

#### Better UX for Larger Screens

- On larger screens, a bottom navigation bar may not be ideal since users need to move their hands more. A Navigation Rail keeps navigation closer to the thumb or cursor, making it easier to interact.

#### Adaptive to Different Screen Sizes
- Navigation Rail is responsive and can be used in tablets, desktops, and foldable screens. It allows seamless transitions between a BottomNavigationBar (for small screens) and Navigation Rail (for large screens).

#### Saves Space While Keeping Navigation Accessible
- Unlike a drawer, which requires an extra tap to open, a Navigation Rail is always visible. It takes up less horizontal space than a traditional sidebar.

#### Supports Icons & Labels for Easy Identification
- It can display icons, labels, and tooltips, improving usability. The user can also collapse it to show only icons to save space.

#### Integrates Well with Material Design Guidelines
- It aligns with Material Design 3 (M3), offering a modern UI look. It helps maintain consistent navigation patterns across Android, iOS, and Web.

#### Improves Accessibility
- Keyboard and screen reader support make it ideal for accessibility-focused apps.
